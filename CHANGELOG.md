# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-16

### New Features :magic_wand:

- **Streaming uploads**. `obstore.put` now supports iterable input, and `obstore.put_async` now supports async iterable input. This means you can pass the output of `obstore.get_async` directly into `obstore.put_async`. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/54
- **Allow passing config options directly** as keyword arguments. Previously, you had to pass all options as a `dict` into the `config` parameter. Now you can pass the elements directly to the store constructor. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/144
- **Readable file-like objects**. Open a readable file-like object with `obstore.open` and `obstore.open_async`. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/33
- **Fsspec integration** by @martindurant in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/63
- Prefix store by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/117
- Python 3.13 wheels by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/95
- Support python timedelta objects as duration config values by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/146
- Add class constructors for store builders. Each store now has an `__init__` method, for easier construction. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/141

### Breaking changes :wrench:

- `get_range`, `get_range_async`, `get_ranges`, and `get_ranges_async` now use **start/end** instead of **offset/length**. This is for consistency with the `range` option of `obstore.get`. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/71

* Return `Bytes` from `GetResult.bytes()` by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/134

### What's Changed

- Streaming list results. `list` now returns an async or sync generator. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/35

- Add put options. Enables custom tags and attributes, as well as "put if not exists". by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/50
- Rename to obstore by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/45
